Like most Mandarin learners, the first transliteration system I learned was Pinyin.  

From the beginning I had my difficulties with it. 
Some of the transliterations just didn't make sense to me. 

But the worst part of my experience was that Pinyin uses Latin characters. 
Whenever I opened Pleco, my eyes were automatically drawn to the familiar letters. 
Thus I had a hard time learning Chinese characters. 

Only after spending some time in Taiwan I realized that there are other transliteration systems. 

My favorite is called 'Bopomofo'.
In this post I will explain too you why I like it so much and why you should give it a try!

# What is Bopomofo
[Bopomofo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo) (also called Zhuyin 注音) is a transliteration system for Mandarin Chinese. 
The name comes from the pronounciation of the first four letters of the Zhuyin alphabet: ㄅ, ㄆ, ㄇ and ㄈ.
In total, Bopomofo consists of 37 characters and four tone marks. 
These allow to transcribe all possible sounds in Mandarin. 
  
Bopomofo is the most used transliteration system for Mandarin in Taiwan. 

So, what makes it so great for Mandarin learners?


# Why Bopomofo is better than Pinyin for western people 

## No distraction by Latin characters
For me, one of the biggest drawbacks of Pinyin is that it uses Latin characters. 
On the one hand it's nice that one doesn't need to learn new characters to use it. 
On the other hand that where its biggest problems lie. 

### Preconceived sound given by Latin characters
My native language is German. 
So when I see the letters 'zui', my brain already has an idea of how they should sound. 
But when learning Mandarin, this is detrimental. 

While it's definitely possible to fight this subconscious sound attribution, that's not how it's supposed to be. 
Learning Mandarin is hard enough. 
Don't fight this unnecessary battle against your brain.  

### Visual distraction
Everytime I opened Pleco, my eyes would do the same thing:
jump straight to the Pinyin. 
It didn't matter how much I tried to force myself to read the characters first. 

That's not a big surprise, since my brain was trained on Latin letters since I was a child. 
Bopomofo counters this problem by using a custom alphabet. 

In the beginning one might think 'What if it slows down my reading?'.
The truth is, it will. 
And that is a good thing. 

Because you will become much slower when reading transliteration, you will do it less. 
Instead, you will focus more on the characters. 
Which is what you should be doing anyway. 


## More concise character input

Most keyboards allow to enter only parts of a word, but still find the whole phrase. So inputting ㄓㄕㄕㄇ would result in 這是什麼.
While Pinyin allows for the same technique, I feel 


## Part of Taiwanese culture
Not only is it often used to express Taiwanese words, 

## Use it as a phonetic alphabet 
(Lautschrift)
