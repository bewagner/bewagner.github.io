# TODO Introduction 
Since I did an exchange semester in Taiwan, I dreamed of learning Taiwanese.

# Spoken Hokkien - textbook
Let's begin with the most obvious: a good textbook. 

When I set out to learn Taiwanese, I wouldn't have thought that it is sooooo hard to find a good text book. 
The one resource everyone mentions online are the [Maryknoll books](http://www.tailingua.com/resources/books/mary.php).
But these are literally impossible to get here in Germany. 

Luckily, I found [Spoken Hokkien](https://speaktaiwanese.com/spoken-hokkien/) by Meili Fang one day.
Not only, does it teach everyday vocabulary, but it's also available as an e-book.

# TV series
## 俗女養成記 
Of the three series this is the one with the least spoken Taiwanese. But it's also funniest. So I can definitely recommend watching it!

# Don't fall for the 八點檔 
When I asked Taiwanese people how to learn Taiwanese, I often got the following answer:
> Just watch 八點檔! That's how I learned it.
[八點檔](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%AB%E9%BB%9E%E6%AA%94) refers to TV dramas that are broadcast at 8PM on weekdays.
