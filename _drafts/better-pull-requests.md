#(Maybe, Maybe not) Recap: What is a PR

# Why?
## Better and faster code reviews
## You are forced to think about your changes
## Documentation for future developers (including future you)

# Review it yourself
The first thing you do after creating the pull request is you should review it yourself.
You might be too entangled in your code to find logical errors. 
But since you know where you worked diligent and where you were sloppy, you're most qualified to **find careless mistakes**. 

And it's also a sign of respect towards the reviewer. 
They will be happy if they can skip cleaning up your code. 
And they will have more time and brain power left to review the logic of your code.

### Unintended changes 
### Mistakes you overlooked
#### Commented code
#### Empty lines
#### Code smells





# Make it small
## Why? 
### people are busy: Bild
### Review quality has negative correlation to number of files changed 
### People will say "Looks good to me"

# How can you split your PR up

# git add -p/--patch

# Write a good summary 

# Focus


What makes a good summary?
- Write what you did
- Write why you did it
- Tell the reviewer what you want
  - Is there anything to review?
  - Where can they be more/less strict

# Add comments to your own PR



# Notifying people that are no reviewers
Sometimes there are changes you want to notify your team members about, without adding them as a reviewer. 
A typical example for this is when the name of a component in your code changes. 
You want everybody on the team to know. 
But it's enough if they have a quick look at the changes.
They don't need to be a reviewer. 

In most project management tools you receive an e-mail every time some mentions you in a PR. 
Type an '@' followed by your colleagues name or shorthand. 
They will be notified an call look at the changes you made.

# Use images/videos  

# Include links?
