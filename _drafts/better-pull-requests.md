#(Maybe, Maybe not) Recap: What is a PR



# Review it yourself

# Make it short

# Use images/videos  

# Write a good summary 

# Focus


What makes a good summary?
- Tell the reviewer what to expect
- Tell the reviewer what you want
- 

# Notifying people that are no reviewers
Sometimes there are changes you want to notify your team members about, without adding them as a reviewer. 
A typical example for this is when the name of a component in your code changes. 
You want everybody on the team to know. 
But it's enough if they have a quick look at the changes.
They don't need to be a reviewer. 

In most project management tools you receive an e-mail every time some mentions you in a PR. 
Type an '@' followed by your colleagues name or shorthand. 
They will be notified an call look at the changes you made.
