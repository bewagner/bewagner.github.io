categories: mandariin

Ever since I started learning Mandarin, I have been using [Pleco](www.pleco.com). 
For most Mandarin learners I've met, it's the most important learning tool. 

Apart from its superb dictionary, I mostly use Pleco for learning flashcards.  
The flashcard feature is very customizable. 
It's very nice that we can shape the app as we need it.
But sometimes I felt like I was getting lost in the abundance of options. 

The way I use the flashcard feature evolved over time. 
Now it is in a state that helps me learn new words more quickly. 



In this post I would like to present you the way I use Pleco's flashcard feature.

## Disclaimer
- TODO My opinion
- Might not fit for you
- I just want to give a preset
- Nice if it works, otherwise just ignore it

## Pleco's flashcard feature


## My learning profiles

### 復習 - Repetition
- Words might stack up. Don't let that stress you out

### 當代中文課程 - Lessons from my textbook 'A Course in Contemporary Chinese'

### 生詞 - New words I encountered in the wild

### 成語 - Chengyu
[成語](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengyu)
- I'm very selective here
- "Only put a Chengyu in your flashcard system if you've heard it at least three times"

## Additional filter profiles

### Words longer than four characters
### Display new words instead of daily repetition

## Customizing the scoring mechanism
