summary:    How you can study Chinese from a textbook if you don't have a teacher that tells you what to do

Now you have a textbook. But how can you use it to study?
If you only look at the characters, you will take a long time to remember. 


While my method may seem obvious to some, it is sure to benefit others. 
That's why I want to share my way of learning Mandarin with you below!

# Find a way to remember the character

# Mnemonics

TODO Describe what mnemonics are 

[mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic).

TODO I need mnemonics only for some characters

I found that mnemonics help me a lot with remembering characters. 
That's why one of the first things I will do for a new character is: 
**Try to find a good mnemonic for the character.**

For some characters this comes naturally. 
Take for example 休. 
It consists of the following radicals.

> 亻=人&emsp;person 
> 
> 木&emsp;tree 

Thus it's natural to think of 'a person that's leaning against a tree resting'. 
Not only does this contain all the character components, but it also gives us the characters meaning. 
That makes this mnemonic a great way of remembering the character. 

## Outlier dictionary
TODO Mention outlier dictionary and how knowing the origin of the character helps with remembering
It's also a very valuable resource for finding mnemonics.


TODO talk about the levels of components to remember

# What to do when the mnemonic is not obvious

But even with this information, some characters are still hard to remember.
This happens a lot for characters that consist of a sound and a meaning component. 
If the sound component makes up a lot of the character, it is hard to connect the characters meaning with it's individual parts. 
For these characters I **try to come up with a story** that connects their meaning to the individual components. 

Let's take 準 as an example. 
According to the Outlier dictionary it consists of:

> 氵= 水&emsp;water
>
> 隼&emsp;falcon

To remember all parts of 準, you can make up a scene that connects both components to its meaning. 
I remember the character as: 
> A pond of water with a falcon sitting next to it that's **prepared** to attack.

Note how I strove to **have the meaning of the character in the mnemonic.** 
Instead of just thinking of a falcon next to a pond, I would think about his preparedness to make sure I remember it. 
I found that I can remember characters more easily if I can **feel the image** I created for them.  
So while writing the character the first few times, I will think about how prepared the falcon is to attack its prey. 
The falcon would have a super strict facial expression to show determination.   

It's always nice if you can encode the spacial relation of the components in the mnemonic. 
By starting with *a pond of water*, I will know that I have to write 氵 first.
Also, the falcon is not flying over the pond, but sits next to it. 
That's how I know 隼 has to be next to 氵, not above or below it.

## If you don't know one of the parts of the character

The technique described above only works if you know all subcomponents.
If you don't know that 隼 means falcon, the mnemonic is worthless.

What you can do is break the character down in even smaller parts. 準 can be separated into:

> 氵= 水&emsp;water
>
> 隹&emsp;small bird
>
> 十&emsp;ten

You could remember 準 as:
> A pond besides which a bird builds ten nests because he has so many kids.

# What about characters with multiple meanings
I just told you that it's important to encode the characters meaning in mnemonic.
Yet, some characters have multiple meanings that differ. 


Remember mnemonic for first meaning. Then I'll know the character and just think about the meaning + character A from word B. 

## When you really can't come up with a good mnemonic

Sometimes I'm just not creative enough to come up with a good image. 

In these cases, I remember the components in the order in which they appear when the character is written. 
This makes memorization easier for me. 
It's worse than a good mnemonic, but better than remembering the character by 'staring at it long enough'. 


# Committing to memory

To commit new words to memory, I write them together with all relevant information by hand. 
This method goes back to the way my teacher at the language center of [National Chengchi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php) taught new vocabulary.
I found that it works  well for me, so I kept it for my self-study. 

For each new word I will write the following three times:
> Character -> Pronounciation -> Definition

For the word 貢獻 it looks like this:

> 貢 ㄍㄨㄥˋ 獻 ㄒㄧㄢˋ contribute, dedicate 
>
> 貢 ㄍㄨㄥˋ 獻 ㄒㄧㄢˋ contribute, dedicate 
>
> 貢 ㄍㄨㄥˋ 獻 ㄒㄧㄢˋ contribute, dedicate 
 
As for what to write for the meaning: I found that my native language works better than English in most cases. 
But for some words English is closer to the Mandarin word. 
Then I'll use English. 

If you haven't seen this way of writing the pronounciation before, it's called [Bopomofo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo).
In my view it's superior to Pinyin. 
Check out [this article](https://bewagner.site/mandarin/2020/08/07/i-love-bopomofo/) for the reasons why. 


# Writing example sentences

TODO Change 'we' to 'I'
So far we have learned the new word, its pronounciation and meaning. 
But this misses one important part of the word: How it is used in a sentence. 
This is especially important for verbs and grammar particles.  
By looking at example sentences, you get a feeling for how the word is used. 

But that is not the only advantage. 
You will also get to know whether the word is used more in written or spoken language. 
And if the usage is limited, you can simply remember parts of the example sentences. 


That's why I my next step is to copy at least three example sentences by hand. 
Everything I mentioned above can be obtained by only reading the sentences. 
Yet, I found that I can better remember a words usage if I copy it by hand. 

# That's it
