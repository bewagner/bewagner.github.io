Now you have a textbook. But how can you use it to study?
If you only look at the characters, you will take a long time to remember. 


While my method may seem obvious to some, it is sure to benefit some. 
That's why I want to share my way of learning Mandarin with you below!


# Disclaimer: This is my way. Doesn't necessarily work for everybody. But maybe there's something in there for you. 



# Mnemonics

TODO mention `CHARS` screen

[mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic).
I found that mnemonics help me a lot with remembering characters. 
That's why one of the first things I will do for a new character is: 
**Try to find a good mnemonic for the character.**

For some characters this comes naturally. 
Take for example 休. 
It consists of the radicals 亻=人=person and 木 which stands for tree. 
Thus it's natural to think of 'a person that's leaning against a tree resting'. 
Not only does this contain all the character components, but it also gives us the characters meaning. 
That makes this mnemonic a great way of remembering this character. 

Other characters require a little more work. 
Example 
準 which contains the components 氵=水=water, 隹=small bird　and 十=ten.




Sometimes I'm just not creative enough to come up with a good mnemonic. 
Tn these cases, I try to at least think of the individual components of the character. [Satz besser machen] 
This makes memorization easier for me. 
Instead of remembering all the aspects at once, I try to memorize the radicals in the order in which their written. 
Then I just have to ...

TODO example 髒

# 3x writing character + meaning (German/English/Chinese/Whatever)

# Order of Pleco tabs and how I use them
# Difference between characters I know and characters I don't know. 
# Write sentences
See how the word is used
# Outlier dictionary


# Back to mnemonics: What about characters with multiple meanings
Remember mnemonic for first meaning. Then I'll know the character and just think about the meaning + character A from word B.
