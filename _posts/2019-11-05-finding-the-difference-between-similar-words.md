summary:    A simple trick to find the difference between similar words in Mandarin

When learning Mandarin, I often encounter vocabulary with an identical English translation.
As an example, Pleco gives 'frugal' as the meaning of 節省, 節儉 and 節約.
Yet, these words are used in different contexts and have slight differences. 

How can you find out where the differences are? And when should you use which word?
Below I'll share my answer to these questions. 

To make it short, my solution is to **google it in Mandarin.** 

If you want to know the difference between characters X and Y, search for 
> X Y 差別

This has lead to an answer to most of my vocabulary related questions so far. Let's see what we get for the words above.

Running a search for '節省 節儉 節約 差別' gets us the following:

Clicking on the [link](https://www.italki.com/question/274511?hl=zh-tw) leads to a page with the following explanation (which I converted to traditional characters for my own convenience).

> 節省指生活當用的必須的也省儉下來少用或不用，如節省開支。“節約”，不該用就不用，如節約糧食，節約時間等。它們可指個人，也指集體。“節儉”通常指個人用錢不浪費，不包括人力、時間在內，如生活很節儉

We can learn that 節省 means to economize things in your daily life. Like 節省開支, cutting down on your expenses. 

Additionally, we learn that 節約 is used for being thrifty. For stuff that you're rationalizing on because you don't have enough of it. The example they give is 節約糧食, rationalizing food.

節儉, on the other hand, is mostly used for money. So you could use it to describe that someone lives a very thrifty lifestyle - 生活很節儉. 


## Some caveats of this technique

Since what I'm telling amounts to 'just search for it in Mandarin!' you have to be able to type and read Chinese characters. So if you're not able to do this yet, it's probably best to find a native speaker that can answer your question.

If you're learning traditional characters like I'm doing, then it's also a good opportunity to learn some simplified characters. A lot of search results will be in simplified characters. If this troubles you, there are a lot of converters all over the internet. I personally use [this](https://www.chinese-tools.com/tools/converter-simptrad.html) one.
