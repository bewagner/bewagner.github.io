![Benjamin Wagner](/images/about.png){:width="30%"}

My name is Benjamin Wagner. I live in southern Germany. Currently, I'm working on software for automated vehicles at [ZF](https://www.zf.com/mobile/en/homepage/homepage.html).

I like to spend my time learning new things about programming languages and learning Mandarin. 
While learning programming and Mandarin, I have relied on many free online resources. 
So on this blog, I would like to give back by sharing some of my experiences!
