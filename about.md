Welcome!
My name is Benjamin Wagner and I'm a machine learning engineer from southern Germany. Currently, I'm working at [ZF](https://www.zf.com/mobile/en/homepage/homepage.html) on making autonomous vehicles a reality.

On this blog I would like to share some aspects of programming I encounter that might be interesting for others. 

I spend a big part of free time learning Mandarin. On this journey I have relied on the many free online resources (like the [Chinese Grammar wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/)). So on my blog, I would also like to give back where I feel competent enough.
