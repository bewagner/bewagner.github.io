Welcome!
My name is Benjamin Wagner. I'm a machine learning engineer from southern Germany. Currently, I'm working on software for automated vehicles at [ZF](https://www.zf.com/mobile/en/homepage/homepage.html).

I like to spend my time learning news things about programming languages and learning Mandarin. 
While learning programming and Mandarin, I have relied on many free online resources. 
So on this blog, I would like to give back by sharing some of my experiences.
